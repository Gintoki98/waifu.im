# Hori-API
### A really useful and easy to use API that allows you to get anime pictures between more than 10 tags and 4000 images !

The API has originally been created to be an alternative to [waifu.pics](https://github.com/Waifu-pics/waifu-api) because the API didnt match some of my requirement (lack of nsfw endpoint for example), therefore i decided to create this API.

The API is documented [here](https://pics.hori.ovh/docs/) and has a unique feature (at the day i write this) that is called Gallerys, indeed you can add your favorite pictures to a gallery (by using the site or the discord bot) and consult them.
You can retrieve a json containing your gallery's pictures by using the API.

Finally i would like to thanks [Riku](https://github.com/Riku32) for firstly creating waifu.pics wich gave me later the idea to create my one, and secondly for giving me precious advices when he didtn't even know me.
